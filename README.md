Logr
====
 - - -

Logr was built with a few simple rules in mind:

1. Less is usually better.
2. The ability to customize is good.
3. Python is awesome.

With these three things in mind, I set out to build a simple static blogging
platform that would allow hackers to spend their time writing, instead of having
to worry about what date format they want to use and how many addons they can
get.

There are still a few things the project needs though, and those are outline in
the next section.

Next Feature
============

I'm working on Markdown support now. Hopefully this will be ready very soon.
