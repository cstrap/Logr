<p>Logr reached a point last night where I felt confident releasing it to the
public and, so far, it seems to be pretty well recieved. I'm still interested
in any feedback the community has to offer, so don't be shy. If you notice
something wrong with the code or can think of a cool feature that should
be added, shoot me a message on GitHub @ <code>BrewerHimself</code>.</p>
<p>The entire reason for creating this project was that other solutions were
too difficult and time consuming. I wanted something simple and it doesn't
get much more simple than editing a text file. With Logr, you just crack
open your favorite text editor (ViM) and type away. When you're done, save
the file and you're done.</p>
<p>There are still a number of things that need to be worked on:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>setup.py</code> needs to be written so the project can be added to PyPI.</li>
<li>A little design work couldn't hurt. Logr is currently built on Bootstrap.</li>
<li>The performance is questionable. We could certainly make things faster.</li>
<li>Having the ability to host articles remotely (via Dropbox, etc.) would
   be cool.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've already had a few pull requests and I'm pretty excited about that, 
especially since this is the first project I've released publicly. Keep the
feedback coming and I'm sure we'll end up with a great product.</p>
